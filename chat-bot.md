Naman Vyas:
Is there anyone who have worked with WhatsApp api or something like implementing a functionality to send and receive Messeges from WhatsApp using python node.js etc

Pankaj Nikam:
> Twilio has one.

Naman Vyas:
That seems to be the only option

Telegram provide their api free of cost.

WhatsApp charge for it.

So it'd be pretty difficult to get that functionality

Anil Sharma:
> https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp

We are using this dll in vfp via . Net dll for sending WhatsApp Message and attachment. Recently they added feature of bot too

Pankaj Nikam:
> True. WhatsApp has third party providers. Wati.io is also there but it's not free either.

Naman Vyas:
Oh I'll check it out for sure.

If it's not free why do people even consider it? They can simply go for WhatsApp business api

Pankaj Nikam:
Public maybe? Lots of people on WhatsApp. Difficult to convince someone to go for Telegram.

Naman Vyas:
Okh

>So as of now I've 3 options to explore :-
	1. Twilio
	2. Github - Rhymen/go-whatsapp
	3. Wati.io (paid)

Pankaj Nikam:
I wish they had good way to integrate directly with Meta instead of these third party providers.

Naman Vyas:
WhatsApp have their official APIs

Known as whatsapp business api

Pankaj Nikam:
Is it public?

Please share the link.

Naman Vyas:
https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api 


No it's not. It's a paid service

WhatsApp send a mail with instructions n all

It's free for 24 hours

Pankaj Nikam:
**We tried it. Never got the mail.
They suggest to go to partner page.**

Anil Sharma:
minimum requirement for Whatsatpp business **Api is 1 lac Api** + facebook business Account page and lots of other drama too.

my client **wasted 3 month** to get this from Whatsapp. But still his company name is under approval.

Taxpro **Nagpur based company** is also selling **Whatsapp Api** based on Rhymen Code. they charged **5000 Rs. for a year** i guess.

>Sumit (सुमित) Suri (सूरी):
https://www.haptik.ai/solutions/whatsapp-enterprise
they were running a **campaign** some time back for **limited but free services**

Pooran Prasad Rajanna:
yes, best way is to go through partners

> yellow.ai — I have contact, If you need intro, I can forward **pooran@get1page.com**

Naman Vyas:
Can u provide the link?

My usage is limited. But is it free?

What is yellow.ai?

Sumit (सुमित) Suri (सूरी):
to the best of my understanding :
Facebook doesnt allow API usage without paying a per message fee
